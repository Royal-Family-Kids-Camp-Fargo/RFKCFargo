Needs: 
- [ ] Password Reset Flow

Bugs:

- [ ] Solve SMS shared template issue: Devii Reference number: Your reference is DCS-54


Ideas: 
- [ ] Track activities for each user based on sms and call clicks
- [ ] Track the number of people contacted vs the number of people who volunteer to accurately predict the number of people who will volunteer
- [ ] Add contact by attaching contact card from phone. (not sure how possible this is)
- [ ] Better Chat UI
- [ ] Fix React Query so when chat changes something, it changes on the screen
- [ ] Natural Language Actions / Automations. I.e. Remind me Tuesday to reach out to Erik Olson. Or Everyday, check if there is a birthday to anyone I'm assigned to and text me a list of them. (Some optimization on the NLAPI's part could be useful here)
- [ ] Connect to Google Drive and be able to ask questions about anything in there. (Have to consider permissions as we wouldn't want to be able to answer questions about specific child applications potentially. But since this is strictly an admin tool, it may be fine.)
- [ ] Record a changelog that is searchable by text.
